# Hackovation 2017 - Open Service Broker API

Welcome to Hackovation, a hackthon by Audi Business Innovation GmbH. The challenge of this hackovation is based on developing service-broker conforming to the Open Service Brokers API, RESTful services, and hardware of your choice. New ideas of managing services, binding services across platforms, automating infrastructure that will shape completely services providing on the cloud.

We strongly believe in the power of open-source software because it is driving innovation! Everything developed during the hackathon will remain open-source projects (MIT) and contribution will continue by Audi Business Innovation. Furthermore, we'll publish some of our service-brokers to the community!
